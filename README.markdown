## Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. I'm keeping them here mostly so I can go
computer-to-computer and not have to constantly rewrite them.

The actual method of deployment mirrors [Zach Holman's
Dotfiles](http://www.github.com/holman/dotfiles), so I recommend you
read that if you're interested in copying mine. Mine aren't quite as
extensive, mind you, so you'll probably get a lot more out of reading
his.

Other dotfiles I encourage you to look at:

- [rtomayko's dotfiles](http://www.github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles);
- [ryanb's dotfiles](http://www.github.com/ryanb/dotfiles);
- [nicholasjhenry's dotfiles](http://www.github.com/nicholasjhenry/dotfiles);
